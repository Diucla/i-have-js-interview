# Callback & Higher Order Functions

A **Higher-Order function** is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
For example, `Array.prototype.map`, `Array.prototype.filter` and `Array.prototype.reduce` are some of the Higher-Order functions built into the language.

About **Callback Functions** they are function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
