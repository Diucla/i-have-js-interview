# Callback & Higher Order Functions

A **Higher-Order function** is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
For example, `Array.prototype.map`, `Array.prototype.filter` and `Array.prototype.reduce` are some of the Higher-Order functions built into the language.

About **Callback Functions** they are function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

## Arrow functions
An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.
