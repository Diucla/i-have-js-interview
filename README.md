# I have Js Interview
I create this repo because i have a Technical Javascript Interview. So here i will share the resources iâ€™m using to prepare myself.

## First lets leave some clear points here.
* I am not a professional in javascript;
* I will not share best practices here;
* I am just a developer wanting to increase your knowledge in javascript;
* Let's have fun.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to prepare myself, for the interview i have in a few weeks. I hope to make at least two commits a day explaining a concept or a particularity of javascript, I will always try to use ECMAScript 2015.

## IDE
I'll be use VSCode, to run my javascript code i installed [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner), to execute a code just click ***Control*** + ***Option*** + ***N*** (or ***Control*** + ***Alt*** + ***N*** on Windows).

I also enabled **Auto Save** with the option `File > Auto Save`.

## What i'll see?
I hope to see first, content about how javascript works, i am talking about Functions & Callbacks, Closure, Promises, some of the concepts i will not go into further, because I already know. I also hope to address issues about Data Structures, Big O, Sorting and Search Algorithms. if i have time i will solve some hackerrank algorithms

## Resorces i am using 

* The first course i recommend is from [Will Sentance](https://twitter.com/willsentance) that will help your to have a solid understanding of callbacks and higher-order functions, closure, asynchronous JavaScript, and object-oriented JavaScript. If you have unlimited access to [FrontendMaster](https://frontendmasters.com/) you can see here the full course here [JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2 by Will Sentance](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) if not, you can see on youtube the course [Javascript the Hard Parts by Will Sentance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVXrJ4dnUxM&list=PLWrQZnG8l0E5hMTpzCK8WjP3nJ93jUEyk);

* The other course is from [Bianca Gandolfo](https://twitter.com/BiancaGando), in this course you'll practice algorithms with common interview questions using a handful of algorithm techniques. This course is free and you can find here [A Practical Guide to Algorithms with JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/)
