# I have Js Interview
I create this repo because i have a Technical Javascript Interview. So here i will share the resources i’m using to prepare myself.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to prepare myself, for the interview i have in a few weeks. I hope to make at least two commits a day explaining a concept or a particularity of javascript, I will always try to use ECMAScript 2015.

## IDE
I'll be use VSCode, to run my javascript code i installed [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner), to execute a code just click ***Control*** + ***Option*** + ***N*** (or ***Control*** + ***Alt*** + ***N*** on Windows).

I also enabled **Auto Save** with the option `File > Auto Save`.

## What i'll see?
I hope to see first, content about how javascript works, i am talking about Functions & Callbacks, Closure, Promises, some of the concepts i will not go into further, because I already know. I also hope to address issues about Data Structures, Big O, Sorting and Search Algorithms. if i have time i will solve some hackerrank algorithms

## Resorces i am using 

* The first course i recommend is from [Will Sentance](https://twitter.com/willsentance) that will help your to have a solid understanding of callbacks and higher-order functions, closure, asynchronous JavaScript, and object-oriented JavaScript. If you have unlimited access to [FrontendMaster](https://frontendmasters.com/) you can see here the full course here [JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2 by Will Sentance](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) if not, you can see on youtube the course [Javascript the Hard Parts by Will Sentance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVXrJ4dnUxM&list=PLWrQZnG8l0E5hMTpzCK8WjP3nJ93jUEyk);

* The other course is from [Bianca Gandolfo](https://twitter.com/BiancaGando), in this course you'll practice algorithms with common interview questions using a handful of algorithm techniques. This course is free and you can find here [A Practical Guide to Algorithms with JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/)

## How to prepare

* **Predict the future**: You can anticipate 90% of the interview questions you’re going to get. “Why do you want this job?” “What’s a tough problem you’ve solved?” If you can’t think of any, Google “most common interview questions.” Write down the top 20 questions you think you’ll get.

* **Plan**: For every question on your list, write down your answer. That will help them stick in your brain, which is important because you want your answers to be automatic.

* **Have a backup plan**: Actually, for every question, write down THREE answers. Why three? You need to have a different, equally good answer for every question because the first interviewer might not like your story. You want the next interviewer to hear a different story and become your advocate.

* **Explain**: We want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Remember we’re not only evaluating your technical ability, but also how you approach problems and try to solve them. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable.

* **Be data-driven**: Every question should be answered with a story that demonstrates you can do what you’re being asked about. “How do you lead?” should be answered with “I’m a collaborative/decisive/whatever leader. Let me tell you about the time I … ”

* **Clarify**: Many of the questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We’re looking to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.

* **Improve** : Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It’s worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it — just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why.
Practice: Everyone gets better with practice. Practice your interview answers—out loud—until you can tell each story clearly and concisely.
