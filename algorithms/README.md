#  Complexity of algorithms

**Space Complexity** - How much memory is used?

**Time Complexity** - How many primitive operatins a executed?

## Time Complexity
Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run to completion. The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the ***big O notation***.

## Big O Notation 

| Name          | constant   | logarithmic  | linear       | quadratic    | exponencial   |
| ------------- |:----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:| :------------:|
| **Notation**  | O(1)       | O(logn)      | O(n)         | O(n^2)       |  O(k^n)       |

## Complexity of Common Operation
| Complexity  |	Operation  |
|:-----------:|:-----------|
|O(1)         |	Running a statement |
|O(1)	      | Value look-up on an array, object, variable |
|O(logn)	  | Loop that cuts problem in half every iteration |
|O(n)      	  | Looping through the values of an array|
|O(n^2)	      | Double nested loops |
|O(n^3)	      | Triple nested loops|
