# Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array.

In other words, a sorted array is an array that is in a particular order. For example, `[a,b,c,d]` is sorted alphabetically, `[1,2,3,4,5]` is a list of integers sorted in increasing order, and `[5,4,3,2,1]` is a list of integers sorted in decreasing order.

Here I will show the most used algorithms, based on these it will be possible to implement any other sorting algorithm.
